# Frontend â€” Public Questionnaire Experience

The Frontend project is the public-facing web application that delivers the questionnaire experience to end users. It renders the start page, sequential questions, and supporting content, applying the service design system and client-side enhancements. It consumes published questionnaire data and guides users through the flow until completion or external destinations.

## Key capabilities
- Display questionnaire start page and guidance
- Render questions and capture answers with validation
- Route users based on answer destinations
- Apply service styling and accessibility patterns
- Provide support and privacy information to users

## User flow (high level)
