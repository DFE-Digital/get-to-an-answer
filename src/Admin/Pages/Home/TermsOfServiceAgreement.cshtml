      These terms apply to the way you use Get-To-An-Answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You accept these terms when you create an account and by continuing to use the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not keep to these terms, we may deactivate your account and remove your forms.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Security
    </h2>
    <p>
      You and your organisation are responsible for deciding if Get-To-An-Answer is suitable to handle the information
      you wish to collect. Do not use Get-To-An-Answer to collect data classified as ‘Secret’ or ‘Top secret’.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must follow your organisation’s policies for using online tools and platforms. Check with your organisation’s
      security or IT team for help with this.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Accessing the platform
    </h3>
    <p>
      You must sign in to Get-To-An-Answer using:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        a secure work-managed device
      </li>
      <li>
        a secure individual work email address that’s protected with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      </li>
      <li>
        a trusted internet connection - do not sign in using an untrusted public wifi network
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Receiving completed questionnaire data
    </h3>
    <p>
      You must only use secure government email addresses for completed forms to be sent to. Make sure they can only be
      accessed by the relevant people. The email addresses you use must follow the <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/securing-government-email">government secure email policy</a>. Check with your
      IT or security team for help with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear in mind that responses to questionnaire questions are not validated for accuracy. People can, for example,
      enter incorrect email addresses or malicious code in their responses. You must check submitted questionnaire data
      looks safe and consider its accuracy before you use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you receive any unexpected or strange messages to an email address that you’ve set for completed forms to be
      sent to, let the Get-To-An-Answer team know.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Report any security breaches
    </h3>
    <p>
      Report any security breaches immediately to Cabinet Office Cyber Security at report@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.
      For example, if you get unexpected emails or security alerts from Auth0 or if you suspect your account might have
      been compromised.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Data protection
    </h2>
    <p>
      You must make sure your use of Get-To-An-Answer to collect personal data complies with data protection legislation
      and your organisation’s policies for collecting, processing and storing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your organisation is the ‘data controller’ for any data you collect using Get-To-An-Answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get help with data protection legislation compliance, speak with your organisation’s data protection officer or
      data protection team.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Make forms that are easy to use and accessible
    </h2>
    <p>
      The platform is designed to help you make forms that are easy to use and accessible, but this also depends on the
      design, structure and content of your questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create a questionnaire, follow government standards and guidance to make sure the questionnaire is easy
      to use and accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read <a href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/create-good-forms">how to make a good questionnaire using
        Get-To-An-Answer</a> for information about making forms accessible and links to further guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speak with your organisation’s GOV.UK publishing or content team to:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        get help with designing, structuring and writing your questionnaire and its questions
      </li>
      <li>
        prepare the starting point on GOV.UK to link to the questionnaire
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Service standards and assurance
    </h2>
    <p>
      Get-To-An-Answer has been assessed against the Service Standard as a platform for making online forms. However,
      you still need to follow your organisation’s policies and processes for service standards and assurance for the
      forms you make with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, forms made using Get-To-An-Answer do not need a service assessment, but you should <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard">check if you
        need a service assessment</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contact the people in your organisation who are responsible for service assurance for help with this.
    </p>
