## Alert Detail



### [ CSP: Failure to Define Directive with No Fallback ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

The Content Security Policy fails to define one of the directives that has no fallback. Missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.

* URL: https://dev.get-to-an-answer.education.gov.uk/en/service-unavailable

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Content-Security-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `frame-ancestors *`
  * Other Info: `The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action is/are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src.`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: https://dev.get-to-an-answer.education.gov.uk/en/service-unavailable

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Content-Security-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `frame-ancestors *`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
script-src, style-src, img-src, connect-src, frame-src, font-src, media-src, object-src, manifest-src, worker-src`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Proxy Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40025/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

2 proxy server(s) were detected or fingerprinted. This information helps a potential attacker to determine
- A list of targets for an attack against the application.
 - Potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers that service the application.
 - The presence or absence of any proxy-based components that might cause attacks against the application to be detected, prevented, or mitigated.

* URL: https://dev-api.get-to-an-answer.education.gov.uk/robots.txt

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: `TRACE, OPTIONS methods with 'Max-Forwards' header. TRACK method.`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Using the TRACE, OPTIONS, and TRACK methods, the following proxy servers have been identified between ZAP and the application/web server:
- Unknown
- Unknown
The following web/application server has been identified:

`


Instances: 2

### Solution

Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.
Disable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
Configure the web and application servers with custom error pages, to prevent 'fingerprintable' product-specific error pages being leaked to the user in the event of HTTP errors, such as 'TRACK' requests for non-existent pages.
Configure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information in the 'Server' and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers.

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: https://dev-api.get-to-an-answer.education.gov.uk

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 2

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`


Instances: 3

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.
